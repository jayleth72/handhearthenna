            <p>At Hand and Heart Body Art, we believe in celebrating art and nature together. Our henna tattoos and
                eco-friendly face paintings are perfect for any celebration, providing a touch of personal expression
                and joy. Our materials are sourced from natural ingredients, ensuring safety and sustainability.</p>
            <p>Founded by Jane Doe, a passionate artist with a deep love for botanical dyes and eco-friendly practices,
                Hand and Heart began as a small booth at local festivals and has grown into a sought-after service for
                weddings, parties, and corporate events. Jane's commitment to quality and eco-consciousness drives every
                aspect of our services.</p>
